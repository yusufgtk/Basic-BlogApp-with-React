# Basic Blog App

## Project Description

This is a simple blog application built with React. It allows users to create, edit, view, and delete blog posts. The app interacts with a backend API (or mock backend such as JSON server) to store and manage the blog data.

This application is intended to showcase basic CRUD operations in a React environment, with a clean and minimal user interface.

## Features

- **Create Blog**: Users can create new blog posts with a title, content, and category.
- **Edit Blog**: Users can edit their existing blog posts.
- **Delete Blog**: Users can delete blog posts they no longer need.
- **View Blogs**: Users can view a list of all blog posts.
- **Category Selection**: Blogs can be categorized by selecting from a predefined list of categories.
- **Form Validation**: The app performs basic validation for title, content, and category when creating or editing a blog post.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Bootstrap (for styling)
- **Backend**: JSON Server (or any mock API) for storing blog data
- **State Management**: Redux (for managing application state)
